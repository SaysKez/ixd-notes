# Week 02 - What is UX Anyway?

## The Five Compentencies of UX Design
1.	Informations Architecture
2.	Interaction Design
3. Usability Engineering
4. Visual Design
5. Prototype Engineering



## 1. Information Architecture
[IA Institue](https://iainstitute.org)

Forms a foundation for UX.

What are the user's primary goals, and how can they achieve them using the application?

-	How do users get from place to place?
-	What rules exist that users have to work around?
-	How are product features and components branded?
-	What is the optimal scope of the feature set?
-	How do the UI/product roadmap position the app in the market
-	How should I enable users to create and store multiple applications?
-	Is there a search mechanism?


### Groundwork
-	Contextual Analysis
- 	Business Process + Rules
-  Product Branding
-  Product + UI roadmap
-  Corporate + Product strategy

### Deliverables
-	


## 2. Interaction Design
Strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the services/products they are using.

-	What layout pattern works best?
- 	Which features/information are of higher importance and how do I draw users' attention to them?
-  How should I incoporate user feedback (testing, research, surveys, etc)?
-  What behaviours occur on dragging, dropping, mouse over, etc?
-  How can I communicate strengths of feature/app
-  How can I satisfy users' primary needs and support the tasks that let them achieve their goals?
-  How can I draw on users' intuition to get them to the next step?
-  How can I ensure users are aware they're performing a subtask that's part of a greater task they've started?
-  How can I use the UI components that are available to me?
-  How can I maintain consistency?

### Groundwork
-	Visual framework
- User feedback
- Form design & flow
- Page level information hierarchy
- application level consistency
- Product Branding
- user motivation
- use of UI Library components
- Labels & Content
- Button Groups & Placement
- etc.

### Deliverables
-	User goals
- wireframes
- key states
- storyboards
- etc.


## 3. Usability Engineering
Find problems with a product. See how well a user carries out tasks. Find where they struggle.

Try to remove yourself from other compentincies when doing this so:

-	You place yourself in the mindset of the user
-	Helps maintain neutrality (rather than being attached to your designs/product)
- 	Gives you perspective on design churn

### Groundwork
-	test goals
- test scripts/tasks
- navigation
- content/terminology
- presentation
- interaction
- participant recruiting
- summative and formative testing
- recommendations

### Deliverables
-	Usability sessions + findings


## 4. Visual Design
Visual design has as much effect on perception of product as the actual usability.

-	Book: Don Norman: Emotional Design

Use of imargery, colour, shapes, typography to enhance usability and improve user experience.

-	Communicates your brand
- Communicates relationships and interactions

### Groundwork
-	visual hierarchy
- colour
- proximity
- typeface
- etc


### Deliverables
-	Style guides
- mockups, etc.


## 5. Prototype Engineering
Ideally an Interaction Designer and prototype engineer work closely to deliver prototypes for testing. Results help determine next steps. Keep iterating.

-	Prototyping offers a huge opportunity for increasing process efficiency


### Groundwork
-	interactive states
- designer's intentions
- existing UI framework
- patterns + components
- technical approach
- etc

### Deliverables
-	UI Component Library
- Prototypes
- Variations on UI Patterns


### Pattern Libraries
Consider your own UI component library: save chunks from past projects (nav, etc.) that work well for reuse.

-	[Pattern Lab](patternlab.io)
- [UI Patterns](ui-patterns.com)
-	boagworld article - How to create a pattern library and why you should.


---

## Product Strategy
-	Know what your app is:
-	Who is it for?
- 	What are the key components?
-  What is needed for a MVP
-  Advertising/Marketing
-  Competitive analysis

Strategy helps you determine what matters and communicate that to your team. It is the foundation of everything you do and future iterations.

### Vision
Who the customers are and what they need. How to plan and deliver a *unique* offering for that (no point givng users the same thing they already have).

### Goals
Define what you want to achieve in the next... (month, quarter, year, 18 months, etc).

New feature? Increase adoption? Grow revenue? Etc.

Keep the focus. Don't drift.


### Initiatives
High level efforts that will help achieve your goals.

E.X: Improving UX to increase adoption.


## Human Behaviour
Understand the psychology behind *why* people do what they do so you can design for them.

# User Personas
**Absolute minimum** of 2 user personas for this project. 3-4 would be better.

>"Treat different people differently. Anything else is a compromise."	
-Seth Godin

Depicted as a specific person but it is really a synthesised version of much research and observation of different people.

### Users are humans
Humans are not computers. They think alogically. Just because *you* know how something works doesn't mean others will understand it.

Think about how the product works in the real world.

Because personality greatly influences our decision-making process, it can be a great tool in design.

### Personas
See:

-	Mail Chimp examples.
- Aaron's personas from last year
- Cooper.com - origin of personas
- Smashing Magazine - a Closer Look at Personas

## Building Personas
1.	Conduct User Research
2. Condense the research
3. Brainstorm
4. Refine
5. Make them realistic

### Elements of a Persona
-	Persona group (i.e. students, manager, etc)
- Fictional name
- job title and responsibilities
- demographics
- Goals/tasks for using product
- Physical, social, and technological environment
- Quote that sums up what matters most to that person
- A picture to bring them life


### People Types
Audiences are nuanced. Don't lump everyone into one category.

-	Geographical
	-	country, city, city area, density, climate, etc.
- Demographic
	-	Age, gender, family size, education, religion, etc.
- Psychographic
	-	lifestyle, etc.
- Behavioural

### Interview and/or Observe
Not just your friends. Find patterns and group them. Create archtypical models based on those groups.

## Tools
-	[UI Faces](https://uifaces.com)
- [Name Generator](https://fakenamegenerator.com)
- **[Open Personas](https://openpersonas.tumblr.com)**
- **[Open Design Kit](https://opendesignkit.org)**

>"Create personas using original research. [...] Brainstormed personas can be used as a starting place but need to be challenged or validated using original research."
-Jen McGinn, Oracle


## Quick'n'Dirty User Testing

### User Testing Tools
-	usertesting.com
- silverbackapp.com

### Guierella User Testing

Set Tasks

-	Different People are different
- Users have vastly differing understanding
- Don't design in a vacuum


## Limitations of Personas
When it comes to usability and experience they can fall short. Don't necessarily hone into the specifics (tastes, hobbies, etc.).

### User Cards
Check gov.uk.

As a... (insert user type)
I want to... (task)
So that I can... (goal)

# Week 03 - Customer Journeys

## 10 Usability Hueristics for User Interface Design
Hueristics = broad rules of thumbs


1. Visibility of system status
	-	keep users informed of what is going on
2.	Match between system and real world
	-	Speak the users' language
	- 	Follow real world conventions
3.	User control and freedom
	-	Clearly mark controls (e.x. exit, return to home)
	- 	Let user's navigate
4.	Consistency and standards
	-	Should not have to wonder if different words/actions mean the same thing
5.	Error prevention
	-	Careful design will prevent errors
	- 	Eliminate error prone procedures and ensure there is feedback (whether successful or failure)
6.	Recognition rather than recall
	-	Minimise user's cognitive load. They shouldn't have to remember pieces.
	- Instructs should be visible/easily retrievable
7.	Flexibility and efficiency of use
	-	Novice might not notice but allow veteran to use speedily. Cater for inexperience and experienced.
8.	Aesthetic and minimalist design
	-	Eliminate unnecessary elements/information
9.	Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors.
	-	What does a 404 mean to a non-tech person? If something goes wrong, explain.
10.	Help and documentation
	-	Focus on the user's tasks and provide help for them to accomplish these if necessary

### Nielsen Norman Group
-	[10 Heuristics](https://nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics)
- 	Recognition vs recall article
-	Check out their newsletter as well


## Customer Journeys
Look beyond the computer, think about the whole ecosystem. How do people find the product? How do they tell others about it?

### Off and On Screen
Consider off screen as much as on screen.

#### Off Screen
How do people find the product?

##### Example Journey map:
-	Pre Engagement
- Commercial
- Consultation
- Initiation
- Coordination
- Completion

##### Examples
-	Lego designing the experience customer journey experience map


## Touchpoints
A touchpoint is any time a customer/potential customer comes in contact with the brand before, during, or after purchase/use.

Put yourselves in the customer's shoes to help see touchpoints.

### What are the touchpoints for when you...
-	Have a problem that needs to be solved?
- Discover the product/business will solve that problem?
- Make your purchase decision?
- Encounter the business after purchase?

### Where do you go (and how do you get there) when you...
-	Want a burger? McDonald's?
	-	All look the same
	- 	Easy to find
	-  Advertising

### Identify your customer touchpoints
-	**Before purchase**
	-	Social media
	- ratings and reviews
	- testimonials
	- word of mouth
	- community involvement
	- advertising
	- marketing/PR
-	**During purchase**
	-	store or office
	- website
	- catalog
	- promotions
	- staff/sales team
	- phone system
	- point of sale
-	**After purchase**
	-	Billing
	- transactional emails
	- marketing emails
	- service and support teams
	- online help centre
	- follow ups
	- thank you cards

After purchase should not be forgotten. You want to keep people coming back.

Always put the customer's need first. **ALWAYS!**



## Onscreen
Customer's journey once they are onscreen?

#### Examples
-	How do you buy something on...
	-	Amazon?
	- Translink?

	
## A Number of Stages...
-	Onboarding
- The Blank Slate
- Getting from A -> B
- Check Out

### Onboarding
Onboarding process. Basically a walkthrough.

#### Examples
-	InVision
- Monzo
	-	Check out the app

### Offboarding
Ever tried to delete a facebook account?

Offboarding is making life easy for users. Unsubscribing? Deleting?

This affects your brand reputation and word of mouth. **Make off-boarding a simple process.**

#### Dark Patterns
Offboarding processes can be purposely bad (try cancelling that Amazon prime subsciption). Ambigious wording, hidden options, hidden costs, pressuring into purchases, updating/upgrading without consent, etc. 

-	Check out [darkpatterns.org](https://darkpatterns.org)
-	Nielsen Needy Design Patterns article

#### Personas and user stories/journeys
-	How would your persona go about unsubscribing/offboarding?
-	What's valuable for them?
-	How would a bad offboarding affect them? What emotions?

#### Empathise
-	Understand the customers needs.
- 	**Don't draw out the process**
-  Convince other stakeholders about offboarding's merit (can be difficult)


### The Blank Slate
-	When you first launch the app.
- When it's loading.
- The first time the user ever uses it.
- When there's nothing there (notifications are empty, etc).

**This needs to be designed too.**

-	Check out [emptystat.es](https://emptystat.es)
- [Figma error page](https://figma.com/404)


### Call To Action
A region of the screen that drives the user to click-through to engage further with a brand. Could be an image/button/etc.

-	Keep it highly visible
- Keep it simple
-	Keep the action clear
- Add a sense of urgency
- Push benefits over features
	-	It's not what you do that sells, it's how that benefits the user
-	Plan a path to conversion.
- Test your CTAS.
	-	Try multiple versions. Test and find what works best.
-	Test your offers.

#### Examples
-	Evernote
- Spotify

#### Read
-	[Boagworld Call to Action](Boagworld.com/design/call-to-action)
- Medium article on CTA


### Getting From A -> B
Everything is a journey.

Make the complex simple

#### Look at:
-	Command Line - language distillation and translation.

#### Examples
-	[gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) vs [gov.ie](https://www.gov.ie)
	-	Try to find car tax rates.

#### Gov.UK
-	Digital Service Standard
-	[design principles](https://www.GOV.UK/design-principles)

1.	Start with needs
2. Do less
	-	Don't keep reinventing, reuse
3.	Design with data
4. Do the hard work to make it simple
5.	Iterate. Then iterate again.
6. Build for inclusion
7. Understand context
8. Build digital services, not websites
9. Be consistent, not uniform
10. Make things open: it makes things better
	-	Gov.uk has a lot of opensource content on GitHub

#### BBC Global Experience Language (GEL)
-	Guidelines how-to
	- How to design assets for apps

--

## Workshop: Design (and redesign) 3 Course Meal
You can't look at project in isolation. Consider the audience. What is their context?

--

## Check Out
What is the checkout process? How many steps?

#### Examples
-	Amazon (of course)


## Experience Mapping

> "Customers are increasingly choosing products and services based on the quality of the experiences they have with them." - Adaptive Path

### The Value Proposition
1.	Creat a shared frame of reference around the customer experience
2. Build organisational knowledge of customer behaviours and needs across channels
3. Identify specific areas of opportunity to drive ideation and innovation
4. Distribute key customer insights in a form that is both usable and easy to understand
5. Further organistaional evolution towards customer-centred thinking

The value of an experience map is directly tied to the quality of the insights.


## Qualitive / Quantitative Research

### Qualitive
- gains understanding of emotions and motivations of users
-	provide insights into setting of a problem and generating ideas
- uncover trends in thought and opinion
- subjective, unstructured

### Quantitative
-	More scientific and measurable
- Larger, randomly selected samples
- To quantify data and generalise results from a sample of the population

--

-	Emotions-based journeys
-	Action-based journeys
-	Key Decision Points Journey

## Over to You: Redesigning the ATM
IDEO redesigning the calendar video


## Benefits of the Customer Journey Map
Look at six revisions article


-	Can identify crucial touchpoints that have the biggest impact on customer satisfaction
- Helps us focus our product towards the user
- We are better able to identify the user's potential needs
- Can provide us with a clear presentation of the whol process carried out by the user
- Can summarise the information that we already have about users and their behaviour
- Helps us locate additional UX improvements, Areas where there's a risk of dissatisfying the user

## Surveys and Questionnaires
-	Should consist of closed questions (yes/no, disagree strongly -> agree strongly)
- Avoid double-barreled questions (feedback + quality of service + feedback)


## Paper -> Sketch -> InVision
Final deliverable is prototype.

#### Step 1: Paper Prototype
-	Speed: Super Fast
-	Fidelity: Relatively Low

Look at feel and function.

Marvel

#### Step 2: Digital Wireframes
-	Speed: Relatively Fast
-	Fidelity: Low

Not strictly necessary

#### Step 3: Functioning Prototype
-	Speed: Super Fast
-	Fidelity: High

# Week 04 - Agile Design

## Agile Design Methods

### Agile Manifesto
-	Individuals and interactions > processes and tools
- Working design > comphrehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration > contract negotiation
- Responding to change > following a Plan

####Cyclical
Discover -> Plan -> Review -> Build -> Repeat/Iterate

Quick. It's not about pixel perfect at this stage, it's about doing right by the user and getting a feel for the product viability.


### Agile Methods

#### Scrum
-	Most structured.
- Clearly defined roles.
- Two week cycle, looking at the backlog in standup and determindg what to work on.
- Building a new product/service -> Enhancing existing features -> Adding new features in each 'sprint'

#### Kanban
-	= 'visual signal' in Japanese
- Good for getting early feedback
- Urgent/important
- Good for identifying bottlenecks

#### LEAN
-	Based on software design methods
-	MVP, learning loops, etc.
-	Reducing waste and delivering content quickly based on evidence and data

#### Pick N Mix
Mix and match to create what works best for your company.



## Google Design Sprint
Companies are leary of committing time/resources to big projects so sprints help move quicker and test as you go for less risky design.

Understand -> Define -> Diverge -> Decide -> Prototype -> Validate -> Iterate

-	developers.google.com/design/sprint
-	Check out video

Sprint Master - Helps define the challenge and split the teams up and choose roles.

-	**Design Audit/Understand**
	-	Look at the product. What's working? What's not?
	- Interviewing stakeholders
	- Reviewing documents
	- Reviewing existing/doing user research
	- Reviewing current designs

### Sprint Stages
-	**Understand**
	- User needs? Business needs? Tech capabilities?
-	**Define**
- **Diverge**
	-	Explore as many different ideas as you can
-	**Decide**
	-	Select the best ideas
-	**Prototype**
	-	Create an artifact you can test with users
-	**Validate**
	-	Test prototype with users

# SUS - Sytem Usability Scale
Inexpensive yet effective tool for assessing the usability of a product. Can be used for just about anything (websites, phones, interactive voice systems, TV apps, etc).

-	10 point questionaire
- Rate from strongly disagree to strongly agree
- Consolidates responses and puts a score: anything above 67 is considered 'good'

### Books
-	Measuring the User Experience - Tom Tullis, Bill Albert

## Measuring the SUS: Does it Change?
Can be bias because the way responses are collected.

This test is not about the interface, it's about the SUS score.

Going to fill in the SUS score now right after test. Then a week after. Then a week after that.

Measuring if responses change over time.

## Ethics
Ethics is super important. Must get approval from organisation and consent from participants.

# Week 08 - Hello Keynote

## Keynote Walkthrough

-	Lots of Keynote UI kits
- keynotopia
-	[capptivate.co github](https://github.com/capptivateco/capptivate)

### Master Apprentice
Best way to learn software. Find something and try to replicate it.

-	Remove elements in inspector in browser
- 	Screen grab those different states and bring into keynote
-  Use to build transistions/explore different states
-  Mask off areas with transitions by cropping images as overlay to hide excess
-	Export as quicktime (mp4). Can pull that into something else or take into photoshop and make a GIF

### Can prototype interactions
- path app UI interactions

# Week 10 - Oblique Strategies

## The Brief
-	Using a supplied deck of cards: Oblique Strategies. Developed by *Brian Eno* and *Peter Schmidt*
-	Where will it be viewed? Responsive? Conversational UI? Connected device?
- 	Aim High

#### Look at
-	Selin Araci
	-	I.O.U connected devices

	
## Oblique Strategies
-	Lots of different cards

### Other Decks
-	Mental Notes
	-	Psychology principles in a deck
-	IDEO Method Cards
- MethodKit.com
-	Notes on Design by Brendan Dawes
- And lots more...

# SUS Score Analysis Results

## Testing the SUS
-	Does the memory/recollection of past ux change over time?
- What is the users memorability of user experience over a three week period?

### Advantages of SUS
-	Can be used on small sample sizes with reliable results
-	Can effectively differentiate between good/bad usability

### Disadvantages of SUS
-	Scoring system is complex
- SUS is not diagnostic


## SUS Score
-	**Measures Usability and Learnability**
-	Aiming for a score of at least around 68

### Calculating the Scores
Can get a spreadsheet to do it automatically.

### Ways to Use SUS
-	Evaluate product/website with SUS score
- Build 2 versions, test with 2 results, compare SUS scores

### How Many to Test?
>"Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford." - Jakob Nielsen

Iterative design/testing is better. Instead of testing once with 15 people, test 3 times with 5 people.


## Over Time
Average of score stayed relatively the same over the three weeks.

---

# Heuristic Evaluation
Usability experts review your site's interface and compare it with established good ux practices.

1.	Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

# Week 11 - Designing for Connected Products

## Connected Products

-	Brendan Dawes Fuzzy Weather
- LYS - Light Tracker which checks your sun intake and gauges sleep
- Wave - a smarter radon detector
- See.Sense bike lights
- Hackaball
- Flic.io - Reprogramable button for whatever device/program you want


## IoT
-	The internet of things isn't new.
-	Think beyond the computer/phone/tablet.

### Stats
-	IoT devices connected to the internet will more than triple by 2020 (to 34 billion)
-	Nearly $6 trillion will be spent on IoT solutions over the next 5 years
-	Governments will the 2nd largest adopters
-	Consumers will actually be the least affected

### Business will be top adopters, using:
1.	Lower operating costs
2.	Increase productivity
3.	Expand to new markets/make new products


### Applications
-	Smart Home
- Smart Locks
- Indoor climate monitor
	-	tracks temp, humidity, air quality, and noise
	- Can set differently for different people/areas
- Conversational UX


## Conversational UX
A user experience in which your interaction with a company/service is automated based on your prior behaviour.
Does not have to be an actual conversation.

The economic reality is that any task that can be automated, will be automated.


## Wearables
-	Smart watches - are they necessary?
-	Fitbit
- Contact lens which monitors glucose for diabetics
- Baby monitors which can monitor breathing
- Bracelet which helps you get a small amount of sun but warns before you get burn

> "I don't necessarily want more devices, I want devices that do more"

Medical industry is huge for IoT/wearables

### Ralph Lauren 
Connected fabrics - An interface embedded in what we wear.
Gets technology out of the way and can allow very natural interactions.

-	Jacquard Yarn
- Monitored heart rate and stress of ballboys/girls at tennis open.

### Levi
Levi brought jean jacket for cyclists to SXSW which maps updates and changes.


## Connected Car
The smart car.

Gartner predicts by year 2020 there will be 250 million connected cars on the road. Whether Self-driving or 'smart' so it can learn your habits, give directions, etc.


## Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality
Augmented and Mixed Reality is more pertinent for immideate future.

### Virtual Reality
-	Emerses user completely in virtual reality
-	motion sickness can be an issue

### Augmented Reality
-	Virtual objects are overlaid with the real world
- The real world enhanced with digital objects
- AR is predicted to have a market revenue of £63 billion by 2020. VR lagging behind.

### Mixed Reality
-	Brings together VR and AR
-	Bring virtual objects into the world you can interact with.
- Interact with both the real world and the virtual environment

### Microsoft Hololens
-	Untethered Mixed reality.
- Hand tracking.
- 3D holograms.

### Google Glasses
-	Google Glass Enterprise edition looking more positive
-	Focusing on business industry
- Ex: using in medical industry. Can bring up notes in real time without needing to check computer or stop engaging with patient.

### Google Cardboard
-	Primarily VR but can also display AR.

### AR Resources
-	ARCore - for Android
-	ARKit - for iOS
- Aframe.io - Mozzile web framework. Mixed Reality coming as well.
- Magic Leap - AR headset
- Facebook Oculus Rift

### Ultrahaptics
-	Touchless feeling
-	Using ultrasound to simulate touch sensation in mid-air
