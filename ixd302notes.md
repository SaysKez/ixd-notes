####What is Creative Entrepreneurship?
Entrepreneurs are everyone's favourite heroes. But what are they really?

1) People that start their own business. 
2) Innovators.
3) Amount of wealth creation
    -   A successful entrepreneurship
4) Speed of wealth creation
    -   Small businesses may create substantional wealth over time but successful creative entrepreneurship creates larger amounts in less time
5) Type of Innovations Created
    -   The critical ingredient is actually doing something
    -   Creative entrepreneurship takes risks

>"The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer" - Nolan Bushnell


####From Service to Product
Our industry has transitioned from service to product. Designers used to exist in a service role (make a website), but now it is also about making products 

*Digital Products* 

-   Icons
-   Typefaces
-   Themes
-   Software as a service (SAAS)
    -   GetInvited (charges service fee)
    -   Typecast (bought by Monotype)
-   Posters, t-shirts, prints, apps, etc.
-   Books
    -   The Manual: a design journal for the web (published for 5 years)
    -   tinybooks.org


####Deliverables & Expectations
20 Credit Module = 200 hours work (roughly 1 day a week)

**Projects - 60%**
-  Digital Product: Icon Set
-  Promotional Website: for the icons, tells a story about the how/why

**Research - 40%**
-   Sketchbook, blog, research, etc.


####Icon Set
-   Minimum of 12 icons.
-   Looking for illustrative icons. Otherwise (ex minimal UI icons), need more/fuller set
-   Abby Ryan, Vic Bell, Scott Park, **Typographic Entomology**
-   Can be anything: characters, cars, furniture, ice cream, etc.

####Supporting Website
-   Tell the story of the icons
-   Why people would use them

#Week 2 // 6-10-17

##The Creative Process

####Icon Research
Icon sets around movies. Groups of 4 icons for each film.

Should be an icon set people can actually use.

####Inspiration

-   Andre Mensati(?)
-   Marco Grenomaro(?)
-   [FlatGuitars](https://flatguitars.com)


####A Little Recap

**Book:** A Technique for Producing Ideas - James Webb Young

1. Gathering the Raw Materials
    -   Specific to a project or simply being curious
    -   >"Spend time falling in love with things that aren't design, and let those things influence your work" - Jessica Hische
2.  Digesting the New Material
    -   Understand the research/data
3.  Unconcious Processing
    -   Stop and let your brain do its thing. Or take a nap.
    -   Sometimes you need to walk away. The worst thing to do is bang your head against a brick wall for ages.
4. The A-Ha Moment
5.  Idea Meets Reality
    -   Test the idea. Get feedback.
    -   Don't work in a silo.
    

####Rituals of Preparation
Habitually creative people often have rituals linked to habits, how they start their day, etc.

Where love, skill, + zeitgeist (spirit or age of time) overlap = most alive

>"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

Stefan Sagmeister: works 7 years, takes 1 year off from commercial clients

#####Your Creative Habit
What works for one might not work for another. Make it easy on yourself.

#####Tharp's Five Big Fears

1.  People will laugh at me
    -   People you care about won't do it. It's what you do that matters.
2.  Someone has done it before
    -   There's nothing new under the sun. It's all been done before. It's what you bring to the project.
3.  I have nothing to say/or make
4.  I will upset someone I love
5.  Once executed the idea will not be as good as it was in my mind
    -   You have to keep going. Better to build something imperfect than to build nothing at all.
    
-   **Use creative triggers**
    -   stick to the same tools, may need background music, etc.
-   **Establish hard edges in your day**
    -   Have a process/schedule
    -   Have schedule for breaks but also checking emails/etc. Last hour of the day do something different.

#####The first steps
When there is nothing left to research and you need an idea. Just staring at a blank page probably won't help.

-   Get up and get out
-   **Scratching:** something to make you scratch your head and inspire you
-   Where do you get your ideas?
-   The more you put in, the more you get out
    -   More you read, research, etc, the more you get out.
-   Look at mentors & heroes
    -   **Harry Beck:** Electrical engineer who drew original London underground map
-   Other people's work
-   Museums
-   Nature
-   Reading

This helps you plan for success.


####Inspiration vs Imitation
Its okay to copy people's work to learn (master apprentice exercises to learn how something was made and discover new techniques) NOT to claim it as your own.

**Focused Copying:** Like the master and apprentice structure of the Renaissance painting masters.

Break things apart and anaylse.

Not everything you make should be on the internet (publicly). Your master apprentice may not be a portfolio piece.

Diversify your inspiration.

History is important. Look at older designers.

Train your eye: what's good and what's bad.

Everybody knows everybody: don't copy to pass off as your own.


####Icon Planning
-   Mind mapping and radial thinking
-   Find illogical connections
-   What's your skillset? Are you illustrative? development? What should you focus on?
-   But never have a favourite weapon: develop your skillset. Use what your good at so you know your weakness, what you need to spend more time on, and can improve.


####Stuck in a Rut
When you can't think of anything and optimism turns to pessimism.

-   Oblique Strategies

Give yourself a second chance.

**Article** Perfectionism Killed My Productivity - Tobias Van Schneider


For the icons: What's the usecase? Who is the target audience?


###To Do:

-   Icon Set + Website = 1 deliverable

-   Immerse yourself in more icons
-   Complete a mind map to get an idea/for your idea
-   Master Apprentice: One icon (from designer you looked at) - Pick an icon and redraw to learn how it its made. Break down to shapes.

By week 3, need to have idea. Good progress by week 6 for critique.

#Week 3 // 13-10-17

##Stand Out From the Crowd

###Inspiration

-   Jeremy Nygun - Achievement badges/stickers for freelancers
-   Ian McDonnell, Design & Art Direction - Set of icons based on tv arials


###Stand Out
Future Island: 

>"You can be stronger when you are not wanting it, if you just do it out of love and trust, then that is when you find what you are looking for" - Samuel T Herring

####James Victore
Series: Burning Questions

You gotta love your work. Be proud to show it off because it excites you. Excitement excites. Work could change lives. Show your work! Show your process, give people something of value more than your work. Make work that matters. Love something.

Never be afraid to show your work.

Put icon on dribbble and ask for feedback.


####Be Nice
Everybody knows everybody.

-   Being nice means action, work, or deed. Return the favour. Even just take a moment to tweet a thank you.

>"Very few people work by themselves and achieve great results by themselves... Most people work with others and are effective with other people. That is true whether they are members of an organisation or independently employed."

>"Managing yourself requires taking responsibility of relationships"

>"Simple things like saying 'please' and 'thank you' and knowing a person's name or asking after their family - enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not."
-Peter Drucker

Manners are often taken foregranted. Don't.

####James Victore: Burning Questions
Be Nice. Good Design is good business. Good Character is good business. Good ethics and morals are good business.


###What Can I Do To Stand Out From the Crowd?

-   You don't just need to stand out from your peers, but designers worldwide.
-   Realise you're part of a larger network
-   Success is more than working 9 to 5. Going above and beyond the call of duty is essential. Show a hunger. Demonstrate a passion.
-   Push yourself to learn new things and new skills.

####Lose the Fear
Fear of ridicule, fear of looking stupid. It's natural to get nervous. 

Push yourself. Use new tools. Don't settle.


####A Great Showcase
You need a great showcase to stand out.

-   Conor O'Driscoll - One Minute With
-   Paddy Donnelly - Shake Hands With A Stranger


####Writing and Sharing
Start a blog. Reflect upon the industry and what you're doing. It doesn't just have to be your work. 

-   Intercom
-   Standardistas
-   Lee Munroe
-   Paddy Donnelly
-   Trent Walton
-   Frank Chimero
-   Jordan Moore
-   Jason Kottke
-   John Gruber - Daring Fireball

#####What Can I Write?
Obviously still learning but you can write about exactly that. Share what it's like living away from home, studying at Uni, IxD, etc.

Talk about current project, inspiration, tools that you use.

>"In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen - really seen." - Brene Brown

**TED Talk:** The Power of Vulnerability


####Side Projects
Do side projects. Don't just do portfolio work/uni work.

**Article:** Student Guide to Web Design - Side Projects

>"I used to let fear of a failed side project keep me from trying new things outside of my normal workload. Or worse, I constantly had ideas for side projects but never actually started any." - Paul Jarvis

**Article:** Paul Jarvis - Side Projects

-   If the Moon Were 1 Pixel
-   The Big Word Project
    -   Paddy Donnelly and Lee Munroe

-   Dribbble
-   Twitter
-   Behance
-   Instagram

#Week 4 // 20-10-17

##Foundations, Goals, and Brands

###Inspiration
-   Charlie Chartwell - A Spectrum of Moustaches

###Building a Foundation
The stronger the foundation, the better stability for business.

-   Focus on the longterm
-   Set financial goals
    -   How much revenue do you need to generate? What profit margin?
-   Assess market conditions
    -   Is there a need for your business? Where does it fit in the market landscape?
-   Consider your skillset
    -   And how best to apply it
-   Be aware of what is happening in your industry
    -   Trends, conferences, events, etc.
-   Implementation
    -   If you can't do something, find someone to do it with you.
-   Have a money backup plan
    -   Make sure you can cover costs

####Create a business model that works for you
-   What do you want to achieve?
-   What is success to you? 

-   What does your day look like?
-   Do you want to work alone or part of a team?
-   Are you building a company?
-   What tasks do you want to do?
    -   What about accounting? Management? Etc.?
-   Where do you work?
    -   In an online business, you could be anywhere.
-   Would you spend a work day differently from a non work day?

####Defining Your business structure
Forde Campbell law in Belfast. Specialise in digital companies.

####How to select the right company structure for you?
First consider goals and business.

-   Sole Trader
    -   No distinction between you and the business. Liable for losses and debts but all profits belong to you. Might need business insurance if sued. 
-   Partnership
    -   Same as Sole Trader but with 2+ people. Need contract between partners. All parties are level for debts and liable.
-   Limited Liability Company (LLC)
    -   Company is a seperate legal entity and can be sold/transfered to different owners.
    
####Choose the Right Name for Your Business
Naming the business sets the tone and defines what you offer. 

-   Building a personal brand
    -   If personal, can use own name.
-   Look towards the future
    -   If you plan on selling, maybe not use your own name.
-   Dream big
    -   Make sure the name isn't limited to one specific niche/area
-   Be flexible
    -   If you can't find the name that you want, modify
-   Do your research
    -   Check if the name has already been taken. What about social media handels?
-   What about a tagline?
-   Get inspiration
-   Don't make it hard for customers

####One Page Business Plan
A road map for you to implement your business model.

-   What type of business?
-   What do you need to do that?
-   How do you do that?

Do it your way. Unless going for investment, you can create it however you like.

Tackle it one subject at a time

Not set in stone, the business can evolve so the plan should too.

####Checklist
-   Business overview
-   Target Market
-   Competitor Analysis
    -   Weaknesses? Where is the opportunity?
-   Your team
-   Marketing Plan
-   Business systems
-   Money


>"Vision without action is a daydream, action without vision is a nightmare" - Japanese Proverbs

####Create Actionable goals
Set goals for yourself and deadlines.

**Goals should be:**

-   Specific
-   Measurable
-   Achievable
-   Realistic
-   Timely

*Example: You want to promote your icons so contact six magazine editors over the next three months by emails with press kit.*

-   What are your goals?
-   Turns these into goal statements
-   Break down into action points
-  Put your actions points in order. Might be easy to work backwards from success.
-   Each point can be broken down into further action points to see how to do each goal.


####Take Action on Your Goals
No amount of research and planning will help unless you act upon it.

-   What my 3 most important goals?
-   What barriers prevent me?
-   Do I have any fears/emotional blocks which prevent me?
-   Do I have an effective productivity model in place?
-   What is the 2/3 action goals which get me closer to completing my goals?
-   What support system do I have?

####Action plan

-   Break down into themes/subjects
-   Prioritise goals
-   Brainstorm
-   Prioritise tasks
-   Create a timeline
-   Stay accountable



###Branding
Branding is more than just a logo, it's everything about your business that communicates a message to your customers.

Effective branding reflects the kind of business you want to be and inspires trust.

####Getting Started
*Think about this for your icons*

-   Brand message
-   Brand values
-   Brand promise
    -   What can customers expect from you? (always on time? Timeframe for email replies? Educating client?)
-   Be Authentic
-   Consistency is Key
    -   Visual and non visual should reflect and reinforce message/values/promise

####Image is Everything
Applies for icons too.

-   Promo materials
-   Branded email with your domain name
-   Always have a domain name
-   Branded social media accounts

Business cards for icons? Could create posters, prints, other materials.

####Brand Personality
Shape how people feel and interact with your company.

Choose brand tone of words to convey personality. Create and establish that voice. Might find it useful to create/find an image that represents your brand (like a user persona). Might also create a user persona for target audience.

Use your brand personality to guide your design.


####Brand Experience
How do people feel when they interact/use your brand/product.

-   Put customer first
-   Be consistent with brand image
-   Storytelling
-   Share your process

-   6 icons completed for week 6 critique
-   Think about other styles (different colours/styles)

#Week 5 // 27-10-17

##Minimum Viable Product

###MVP
A Minimum Viable Product is selling the vision and delivering the minimum feature set. It's like a plain donut, if the market likes it we can add a variety of toppings/flavours.

Minimum on it's own is slow/unhelpful/boring.
Viable is longterm and expensive. MVP is the perfect middle ground. It is not the final product, it is an experiment to test if you're customers actually want. It's the fastest, cheapest thing you can make and get into the hands of customers to get feedback.

-   M - Minimum: The absolute necessary features from day 1 to solve customers' top problems.
-   V - Viable: Solve real world problems. What will customers 'pay' for?
-   P - Product: Useful, deliver real value.

Shouldn't hold on to a product until it is 'perfect'. Need to show before investing heavy so iterations can improve and build best product.

####Zappos
Origin story case study. Not a scalable business but an experiment to determine if there is a demand for online shopping experience for shoes.

####"Wizard of Oz" MVP
Looks like a working product but is actually a shiny front with you manually completing all the operations (transactions, delivery, etc.)

####Groupon
Started solely in Chicago, then expanded to other cities.

###Building a Lean MVP
If you're starting something you don't want to invest too much time/money

-   Using a static website
-   Using existing tools & platforms
-   Email
-   Blog
-   Social Networks
-   Doing it manually.

>   "People don't want a quarter inch drill, they want a quarter inch hole." - Theodore Levitt

MVP - version of new product which allows team to collect maximum amount of data/feedback with least amount of investment.

####Iteration:
-   Build a rough prototype
-   Test and gather feedback
-   Apply insights
-   Go back to 1

###Smoke Test
**Maestro** - a menu creation app idea by Chris Armstrong. Wasn't sure it was viable so decided to abandon the product. Now working on @Niice app. Has built something functional this time so can test and see what works.

Airbnb - PSFK Conference origin story talk. Built first site in 24hrs. Used conferences to time launch so they could contact press. Crazy stunts (breakfast cereal boxes based on Obama and McCain) to promote and fund site. Travelled to visit people using site.


###The MVP is dead. Long live the RAT
MVP can be applied to a launch, when it is 

RAT - Riskiest Assumption Test. No need to build more than your riskiest assumption/feature. What is the one thing that needs to work?

>"Maximising the rate of learning by minimising the time to try things" - Tom Chi, Google X

Never think it's too early to test.

RAT removes the temptation of building a full blown product you think is awesome but doesn't work.

#Week 7 // 10-11-17

##Guest Lecturer: Philip Strain

From Portadown originally. Studied music before computer science

Sonic Arts Research Center placement.

Microsoft usability standards: permanent, temporary, and situational disability

Build connections and reach out. Google internship. 

Look at how can you add value with your side projects. Get them out there.

###2005: Usability Analyst
###2006: User Experience Researcher

User Research Methods: Qualitative and Quantitative (Nielsen Norman)

Research: what people say and what they actually do can be completely different which is why it is important observe.

As a designer it's easy to just jump in to solving the problem but it is important to define the problem and also sell the problem.

Developed headings for google search results to help for screen readers


###2007: Set up a company: Ecliptic, developing apps
A cofounder is kind of like a marriage. You're signing a legal agreement with this person so you need to choose really *really* carefully and don't forget a 'pre-nuptial'.

A company can be like a child: at the start it is a baby requiring constant care and sleepless nights.


###Google offered a full time job
>"If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. You just get on."

Worked on accessibility in Google in America. Then moved to London to continue working for Google on adsense. 

###Open Heart Surgery
After in London for a year. Realised you must work on something that is meaningful for you. Got a message from Apple recuiter to help with accessibility.

###Apple
Spent a year and a half there.
A much more closed environment than Google but felt meaningful because they cared so much about accessibility. For a blind person, using the iPhone should be an identical experience.

###Spotify
Offer on LinkedIn. User Researcher in Product Insights team which blends Data Science and User Research.

Think it -> Build it -> Ship it -> Tweak it

####Think it

#Week 9 // 24-11-17

##Pricing and Positioning

### Final Submission
-   8th January 2018 12:00pm
-   All submissions on Blackboard

#### Deliverables:
-   Digital Product (12 icons)
-   Promotional Website
-   Research, Discovery, Sketchbook (Blog)


## Money, Money, Money
You need to earn a living, but what if you could earn a living while doing something you're passionate about?

The venn diagram of passion, skill, and money.


### First things first
You deserve to be paid (and more than minimum wage)

You love what you do but that doesn't mean you don't deserve to be paid for it.

Years of experience has value. You have invested time to learn your craft: that has value.


### Rates
Per day you should probably be charging £100/day minimum = about £13/hour

UK Freelance Rates Calculator website.

### Your Mileage May Vary
Do some research and ask around

#### Negotiation
Setting the price is a negotiation. You and the client need to discuss.

>"I'll need to talk to X, they run the business and do all the billing"

Keeps it friendly between you and the client, distances budget from you.


### Knowledge + Skill = Value
1 hr /= 1 hr.

A beginner works slower and is not as experienced. Their hour /= expert's hour.

>"It took me a few seconds to draw it, but it took me 34 years to learn how to draw it in a few seconds."
- Paula Scher


## Pricing Strategies

### Price by the project
-   What is required?
-   What does the client want?
-   Get the scope of the project and price accordingly (including maybe learning time)


### Time, Scope, and Budget
The Triangle.

-   Limited budget? Tighten the scope.
-   Huge scope? Raise the budget.


### Budget
Get the budget up front. Know exactly how much money you have before you start. Always ask "what's your the budget?"

Prevent shock and disappointment at the end.


### Track Time
Not always, but helps you learn how long it takes you to do something so you can make informed judgements for future projects.

Some clients also want that.

David Shae has tools for this: *The Emergent Task Planner*


### Tools
-   FreeAgent
    -   Manages finances
-   Harvest


### A Note on Buy Ins
Buy Ins = things you need to buy for the project (paper, parking, photocopies, coffee with client, internet, phone, expenses, etc.)

**Keep all your receipts!** And keep them organised.

#### Mark Up on Buy Ins
expense + 25%.

Why? You won't be paid for a while, are incurring risk (if you're not paid), losing interest on that money, and your own effort.


### Different Folks, Different Strokes
But depends on the client.

-   Charitable Organisations
-   Public Sector
-   Private Sector



## Professionalism

#### It's All About You
-   Be known for what you do
-   Always deliver
-   Be known for who you are
-   Help other people
-   Under promise, over deliver

Everyone knows everyone. Your reputation goes before you.


### Write everything down
-   Email trail
-   What is expected
-   delivarables
-   Every meeting with the client

Keep in contact with your client. Good communication: every couple of days. Not just start of the project and than silence.


### Contracts
Before you start, have something down on paper.

**Andy Clarke Contract Killer**

-   Terms: 30 days (your may differ)
-   Invoicing on time is critical



#### Get an up front payment
-   Ask for a deposit
-   30%..?

Helps you and covers cost, client also then has a buy in.

#### Default on Payments
Threat of legal action (so have a contract!)


### Pricing Show and Tell
Work out the material costs and all you costs first for physical products/crafting.



### Time = Money
Don't make the mistake of losing track of the time (just because you love what you do)

People love a wee discount (so maybe if you get it done in less time than you thought)


### Build a Pricing Pipeline
-   One Product: 50% buy/50% not buy
-   Three Products: 75% buy/25% not buy

Shift prospective customer mindset from "will I buy" to "which one will I buy?"


### Pricing Tiers
Pricing tiers can draw attention to particular product/tier

#### Give Your Tiers Names
Remember we're telling a story.

#### Customer Lifetime Value
80 / 20 : focus on 20.

Your existing customers often have the most to offer, don't neglect them.

>"80% of your sales come from 20% of your customers"

Build up a customer base and reward them. Don't lose focus by chasing after the other 80% all the time.

Common for company's to have two different pricing models (say personal and enterprise)
