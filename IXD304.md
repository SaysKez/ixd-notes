# IXD304 Narrative and Storytelling
---

# Week 01

## Introduction
20 Credits = around 200 hours

Examining how storytelling can be used to enhance storytelling. Considers:

-   art direction
-   pacing
-   narrative

and how they can be used to control the flow of information.

### Stories Unfold
Look at:
-   Apple: iPhone X product page.
-   Horizontal - If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel

This is the web. You can use as much space as you want.


## Deliverables

-   Deliverable 1: Narrative Web Site (60%)
-   Deliverable 2: Prototypes (40%)
    -   Master Apprentice Exercises
    -   Research Blog
    -   Sketchbooks
    
### Research
Look at books, films, games, animations, beyond. Not just behance/dribbble/pinterest.

### Deadline - 8th of May
8th May 2018. No week after semester ends.


## Brief
Designing a single page web site for pre-existing content. The content is sectioned, various asides, maps and charts, allowing for interpretation. Storytelling should come to the fore and is the focus without the need to generate content.

Content is raw text, needs to be structured.

Do not have to stick with National Geographic styling/brand.

Some images supplied. Do not just stick to these. Find more. Restructure. Etc.

### We're Looking for...

-   narrative and storytelling
-   pacing, pauses
-   visual vocabularies
-   transitions

### Previous Examples
-   Andrew Whann
-   Hayley Gregg
    -   typographic
    -   not much colour
-   Kelsey Bones
    -   focus on National Geographic brand
-   Amy Graham
    -   Illustrated approach
    -   Nice headings
-   Inga Hampton
    -   Heavily illustrated
    -   Map is nicely done
-   Aaron McAlinden
    -   National Geographic branding
    -   Photographic
    -   Scroll triggered animations
-   More examples on IXD portfolios


## Master Apprentice
-   Rather than being a complete website, they are going to be a testing ground while working on main product.
-   Will be looking at one every other week.

# Week 02 - The Narrative Experience

## Things to Be Doing
-   Bird Project
    -   Markup
-   Master Apprentice: Responsive Storytelling
-   Research blog



## Narrative
Stories are what we share. They are memorable. Humans fill in the blanks: adding story where there may not even be one.

### Storytelling
The way you dress stories. How is it delivered? It's not just the story: it's the pictures, where you are while you hear it, tone of voice, moods, mannerisms, clothes, etc.

#### The Journey
A start, middle, and end.

#### Time
How we measure events. Begins unpredictably (entropy) and grows more predictable as events unfold. Can subvert those expectations.


## The Great Storytellers

>"A narrative is an individuals perspective of the surrounding landscape" - Mark Stephen Meadows

>"Stories are technology for packaging wisdom" - Norma Cameron

-   Lascaux Caves
    -   We've been telling stories (through art, no less) for millienium. 
-   Maps
    -   Help us navigate but also tell a story. Creator's view of the world. Also your journey.
-   Directors
    -   Films and scripts. 
-   Scientists
    -   Unravel stories of the natural world.
-   Politicians
    -   Stories of the day to day. News.
-   Authors
-   Artists
    -   Even how work progresses from one work to another
-   Songwriters
-   Your Granny


## Independent Narrative Blocks
Narrative needn't exist together all in the same place at the same time. THink how narrative content blocks exist and link together

### Mobstr
Street artists. Considers the removal of his art part of the story.

-   See: *"The story"*. Keeps being painted over.


### Narrative on the Web
A List Apart article: usability and web narrative
>"The readers journey through our site is a narrative experience"


## Enacted Narrative
-   Story structured around character's movements
-   Books are a good example. Typically take a linear approach

### The Problem?
-   the web is not linear
-   The problem with reading longform on screen is you're only 2 clicks away from a man inhaling a lemon on YouTube.

>"Providing meaning to a mass of unrelated needs, ideas, words, and pictures - it is the designer's job to give meaning..."
-   Paul Rand

As designers, we have to tell the story (not only in the product/brand/website/etc but to the client).

Enacted Narratives are more than a pretty picture. It must have good content, good substance.

Equally, good content but bad form does not sell either. Can be difficult to use.

Need to achieve a balance between form and content. Don't ignore one or the other.

### On the web
-   Amazon, Apple, Eyekiller




## Emergent Narratives
Where spaces are designed to be rich with potential, enabling the story-constructing activities of the players.

-   Infograph of The Mystery of Chimney Rock choose your own adventure
-   Website which breaks them down.

### On the web
-   Dribbble, flickr, github, twitter
-   Emergent narrative websites are where spaces are designed to be rich with content by enabling the contribution of the user
-   Video games: Grand Theft Auto. Open world environment.



## Learning Styles
Many sites exist to teach the user. Ex: Amazon is teaching users about a product and why they should buy it. Understand a users learning style so you can design for them

-   Activisits
    -   Like learning as they go, Work things out as they go.
    -   Jump in.
    -   Open minded.
-   Reflectors
    -   Prefer to be guided, time to take it all in
    -   Like to observe from different perspectives and may come back and read again
-   Theorists
    -   Like to make things logical.
    -   Work through the problem before leaping in.
    -   Take time before applying learning
-   Pragmatists
    -   Like the practical applications of ideas, concepts, and techniques
    -   Search out ideas so they can experiment with them

### Behaviour
People are not just one or the other. May mix or be one in a particular enviroment and another somewhere else.

-   Activists
    -   Need good navigation to aid exploration
-   Reflectors
    -   Need information to read, guided tours to establish facts, 'save for later'/remembering session helpful
-   Theorists
    -   Clear documentation: what this site/product is.
-   Pragmatists
    -   Evaluate quickly. Helped by uncluttered, concise information
    

>"We are narrative architects, designing spaces where stories are told." -Henry Jenkins


## The End
You are the storyteller. Think about the bird article as a script:

-   how will you direct it?
-   What emotions should the user feel?
-   Is it a comedy? Thriller? For kids? Audlts?
-   What sort of narrative type is it?

### Tips for Your Project
-   Consider breakpoints in the story. Where are the pauses? Can those content blocks exist independently?
-   Does it change when viewed from different perspective? Are their multiple paths/characters?
-   What feeling does it evoke? Is it appropriate for the content? What will the story world look like?
-   Is the narrative immersive?
-   Does the device matter? Don't just think of it as a website.
-   Will people remember where they are?

# Week 04 - Art Direction on Paper

## What is Art Direction?
>"A designer is concerned with execution, while an art director is concerned with the strategy behind that execution." -Phil Coffman, Art Director, Springbox

### A to B
Rynair or The Orient Express? The destination may be the same but the journey is completely different. The direction you choose will shape the journey which in turn shapes the experience.

#### Read
-   A List Apart: Art Direction and the Web
-   A List Apart - Art Direction and Design

Dan Mall defines art direction as enhancing a story and aplifying the meaning.

Art direction gives substance to design.

>"How do candles transform a regular meal into a romantic evening?" -Dan Mall

>"Art direction is about evoking the right emotion, it's about creating that connection to what you're seeing and experiencing." - Dan Mall

### Art direction /= Design. 
Design may be ugly but it can still communicate the message. Vice versa, may be beautiful and/or functional but lacking in substance.


-   **Colour:**
    -   *Art Direction:* Does this colour scheme fit the brand? Is it appropriate?
    -   *Design:* Do these colours look good together? Contrast? Best for medium?
-   **Typography:**
    -
    
### Case Study: New York Times
Update design but art direction remains the same.


### Telling Stories
**Jason Sante Maria** - Every article was design for the person, art directed for each unique feature.




## Directions
Look from different directions. 

-   Is this about Dr. Orbell, the adventurer? Inspiration: Indiana Jones
-   Is this about the bird, avoiding extinction in a big bad world? Inspiration: Nemo. Audience: Children
-   A New Zealand Gazetter. Scientific maps and atlas, historically appropriate. Inspiration: old gazetters

The choices we make and the directions we adopt enhance and can even change the story.




## Learning from Print
Take it off screen. Widen your visual vocabulary. 

### Read
-   24ways.org - Good Ideas Grow on Paper
-   Standardistas - Visual Grammar

### Magazine
-   i-D - Terry Jones
    -   Rough and ready, can almost see the photo cutouts
-   Raygun - David Carson
    -   Experimental.
    -   Clarity not a concern.
-   Monocle - launched in '07
    -   Looks at global affairs, design, and more
    -   Much more structured. Meaty design and content
-   Speak
    -   Long form interviews, essays, stories, etc.
    -   UNcommercial, expensive print
    -   Shades of Carson (Raygun) in layout.
-   The Economist
    -   Completely different. Consistent art direction. Clean structure.
-   Time
    -   Very effective. Emphasis on cover.
    
Remember, does not always have to be completely clear. If the images overlapping with the headings enhances the story, do it. Experiment.
    
    
### Books
Maybe not novels with pages of text but what about book covers? 

-   Ship of Theseus - V.M Straka + JJ Abrams
    -   Even have false sticker like it was a library book.
    -   Smells old.
    -   Handwritten notes style in Pages
    -   Inserts: postcards, leaflets, etc.
    -   How would you interpret that on the web? Think about it.
-   Jonathan Safran - Tree of Codes (visual editions)
    -   contents chopped up from Street of Crocodiles
    -   Cutouts completely change the story. Read one page at a time? Two?
-   Calandar
    -   Really long, narrow format
    -   Hole punch months
    -   Heat sensitive ink so photos change colour
    -   Braille printed on photos
-   The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman
    -   Lots of redactions


## What About Books on the Web?
Do we read on the web? How does that compare to epub? Physical copies?

-   editions at play
    -   A new venture from Visual Editions.
    -   Looking at a book on the phone.
-   Ambient Literature
    -   Breathe: A Ghost Story - Ghost story which uses your location and grabs images.

Push the web forward in terms of storytelling. It is a limitless canvas: play around.


## Remember What You Are Doing
**Art Direction**

-   Maybe Takhe inspiration is from web and Heroes and Villains from web?
-   Contrast? Compliment? Use the Heroes & Villains as a testing ground. Think of it as a scrapbook.

## Interacting with the World

>"Interaction Design can focus both on leveraging experiences people already have and designing new ways for humans to interact with things" - Tim Potter

>"You can no longer afford to be ordinary. As the limitations fall away, expectaions rise."

The concept of a two way effect is essential to interaction design.

>"The only intuitive interface is the nipple. After that everything's learned." - Wilson Meir talk at Build conference

#### Look at:
-   Diagram: how to use Magazine


### Paradigms are Changing
-   Desktop: Hover
-   Mobile: Touch
-   Mobile: Force Touch
    -   Haptics, technology still developing.
    

### Interactions are all around us
-   Pull to Refresh
-   Swipe
-   Pinch to Zomm
-   Etc.


### Interaction Design
But it's not all about technology. It's about creating those interactions that work seamlessly and resonate with people, regardless of device/application

>"Interaction Design can focus both on leveraging experiences people already have and designing new ways for humans to interact with things" - Tim Potter

It's about shaping digital(?) products for people to use. Could be digital, environments, etc.


### iPhone Case Study
-   Swipe to unlock: new, required guidance/help originally (and has now been replaced entirely)
-   Passcode: based in learned experiences (keypads)
-   Swipe to refresh: new but grounded in other experiences (drawsting lights, switches)





## Mircointeractions

### Classic Animation Concepts
Transitions are the sprinkles on top

#### Look At
-   Giving Animations Life - Medium article
-   Path app interactions
- From here to there, transistions in design - Brendan Dawes

>"I've always had a strong held belief that the most important property within a design is the use of transistions" - Brendan Dawes


### UX
It's all about the user experience.

UX - The overall experience of a person using a product, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it it to use.

-   How does it make you feel?
-   Is it easy to use?
-   What kind of feedback do you get?


### Delight or fright?
Can go the other way. Bombarded with ads, intrusive animations, etc.

>"Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent" - Joe Sparano


### Micro-interactions
-   [Motion Experiments](michaelvillar.com/motion)
-   Smart Transitions in User Experience Design - Smashing Mag
-   Designing Micro-interactions: the action button - medium

>"Some websites outperform others, whether in their content, usability, design, features, etc. Details of interaction design and animation make a fundamental difference on modern websites." - Adrian Zumbrunnen

>"It's not just what is looks like and feels like. It's how it works." - Steve Jobs

#### Look at a single element, like a button.
-   What happens when you hover?
-   What are you *expecting* when you hover?
-   What about click/touch?
-   How do those look and feel?


#### A Button From the Olden Days
From skeuomorphism to flat.

Trends come and go, it's up to you to set them not follow them.


### Stateful Toggle
Transistions help users understand the pace and flow of an UI and how you go from one state to another.

Make your element understandable in each state.

#### Animated Scrolling
A jump can be jarring. How do you maintain context? Make the experience smooth and understandable.

Abtupt changes in an interface are hard for users to process. Don't leave them in the dark: show them what's happening.

#### Sticky Labels
Labels scrolling along with content can help retain context.




## How Does it Interact?
There's a lot you can do with CSS. Don't even need to use JS.

-   tympanus.net/codrops
-   hoverstat.es
-   Lots of CSS animations and button styles available

It's not just about flashy interaction, it's making sure they are right for the job.

Experiment with these. Have a dev section on your portfolio. Show you're learning.


### This is how you get your name out there
-   solve some problems
-   make something
-   share what you learned
-   rinse
-   repeat


### Why Bother?
A little extra effort makes all the difference.

This is not a time to be ordinary.



## Tools
-   Codepen.io
-   CSS Animation 101
-   Animate.css

# Week 09 - Wonderful World of Maps

## What's an API exactly
*Application Programming Interface* is a set of rules and specifications that software programs can follow to communicate or 'interface' with one another.

A way for different apps to talk to each other.

-   [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io)
-   [Twitter](developer.twitter.com)
-   [Instagram](developers.facebook.com/products/instagram/)
-   [Google](developers.google.com/)


## How Does it Work
1.  Register
2.  Authenticate
    -   Understand that you want to pull in requests
3.  Request

An API is the messenger which takes your requests to the system and then returns the response back to you.

Ex: travel aggregator. Communicates with API of different flight databases.

#### PROs:
-   Reduce heavy lifting
-   Off-the-shelf solutions
-   Ease of Use

#### CONs:
-   Cost (sometimes)
-   Content is beyond your control (if twitter change their API or services goes down, so does your content)
-   Terms of service 


## Getting Creative With Maps
Mashup external applications to create a more interesting result.

Combine map and data for awesome

### Mapping Resources
-   Google Maps API
-   OpenStreetMap
-   Leaflet.js
-   Mapbox
-   Mapstylr
-   Stamen Maps



## Master Apprentice

### Google Maps
-   Google Maps API guide
-   Get a key
-   Find the longitude and latitude
-   Can specify and style pins

### Leaflet.js Tutorials

### Stamen Maps
-   Can also grab as an image
-   CHECK OUT RGB dot version


## Do I Need an API Key?
An API Key is a code passed in by computer programs calling an API to identify the calling program, its developer, etc

## Notes
-   Should have an interactive map.

# Week 11 - Performance Matters

## Fat Fighters
We have a problem and it's getting worse. Lazy designers, 'designing' for broadband and failing to optimise.

### Factors affecting frowing size (and decreasing speed) of webpages
-   Video is growing
-   Image volume + size
-   Web font usage

Average website in 2017 (3034kb) is x3 the size of one in 2011 (929kb).

3MB is big!! People are browsing on mobile, probably using data, and that is eating into it.

### 1GB = How Many Webpages?
-   On average that's about **450** web pages
-   Send/receive 13,000 emails
-   View 10,000 instagram images
-   Share 200 photos
-   Stream 7 hours of music
-   Stream 4 hours video

### Global Data
The internet is global. Need to consider data usage and coverage not just where you are.

-   OpenSignal - data and coverage for world



## Squeeze Everything
As designers we have a responsibility to optimise

### Save Bytes Everywhere
-   HTTP Requests
-   Sprites and Images
-   Minify. Compress
-   Naming Conventions
-   Folder Structure

### HTTP Requests
Has to contact the server for:

-  HTML
-   CSS
-   JS
-   Images
-   fonts
-   libraries
-   etc.

**Read** - Yahoo: Best Practices for Speeding up Your Web Site

Consider your dependencies and reduce!


### Sprites
Combine all icons onto a single img/file (save on requests) and pull them out as needed.

### Images
COMPRESS!!

**Read** - Jeremy Keith Image Compression

>"I want the site to look great, but I also very much wanted it to feel great... and nothing affects the feel of a site (the user's experience) more than performance." - Jeremy Keith

#### Tools
-   Photoshop - 80%-60% will give much smaller but still decent images
-   ImageOptim
-   TinyPNG


### Concatenate
Combine style sheets, JS, etc.

### Minify
-   Minify CSS + JS
-   Makes script much smaller and increases speed
-   Also makes it harder to decipher.

There are online services which will do it for you.

### Compress
Gzip compresses your webpages and stylesheets before sending them which can drastically increase transfer speed

### Naming Conventions
-   Shorter (but Understandable)
    -   Background -> bg
-   Folder Structure
    -   /images/ -> /img/ -> /i/
-   ID takes up more space than a class

### Dependencies
Don't go for JS/JQuery if you can do it in CSS

#### Sites
-   You may not need JS site
-   You might not need jquery plugins


### Laziness Costs
-   DON'T be lazy
-   DON'T go type crazy
    -   You don't need many fonts for good design, so why do you need them for your webpage?


## Grunt, Gulp, Etc.
The less work you have to while performing repetitive tasks, the easier your job becomes.

Tools which can automate that all for you.
