# JavaScript Basics

## What is JavaScript

-	Programming language: you write stuff, it does things
- Allows interactivity in sites
	- Load in content after the content has loaded (AJAX requests)
	- Trigger Animations
	- Form Validation
	- Advertising


## When to Use JavaScript

-	When you need user interaction: when something happens in response to a user's interaction
- When it's nice to have but not necessary


## JavaScript in HTML

-	Just like CSS, JS has rules for usage.

### Load in
`<head><script /></head>`

-	Good for some stuff (like moderniser to check version).
- But blocks render until that JS loads.

`<script /></body`

-	Much better, loads after content.
- Doesn't block content.


## Some Simple Rules

-	JavaScript is where ID attributes can be useful.
	-	Even then, should be used sparingly so code can be used in different instances.
	- Just like with CSS, you want JS to be re-usable when appropriate.


## Basics

### Variables
`var name;`

-	Define a variable.
- Can be anything
	-	a string
	- array
	- numbers
	- object
	- etc.
-	These can be changed.

*Variables contain content. Functions do stuff.*


### Constants
`const pi = 22/7`

-	Same as variable
-	But set in stone


### Functions
-	Let you do stuff
- Are dependant upon being told to run


#### Event Listeners
-	Let you tell a function to run
- Can be based on pretty much anything you can do on a web page
	-	Click
	- Keypress (shortcuts)
	- Mouse Hover
	- Drag/Drop
	- Form validation


## Lessons From Demo

-	Beware if JavaScript loads before the element it is interacting with. Won't work. One reason to avoid putting JS in head.
- Always make it accessible (if someone doesn't have JS on or browser old)
	-	But if something else won't work down the line, can use (if JS is necessary for payment, the widget might be JS powered).


### Maps
- Uses Mapbox for map display: more control over style
- LeafletJS


## JQuery
-	Simplifies.
- But good to learn JS basics first. Otherwise like using a CSS framework before learning CSS
