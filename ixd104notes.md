#Week 2
##IXD104//FRIDAY//10-2-17

###Getting Iconic

####Research Juice

-   Paul Elliman
-   Olly Moss
-   Michael Rose
-   Rogie King
-   [Paddy Donnelly](http://lefft.com/)


####Icon Design
>Trying to capture the essence of an object/idea with only a few lines while maintaining its elegance.
Icons are tiny poems.
-Kyle Tezak

**Icons are old as old as the hills**
-   Cave paintings
-   Olympic icons
-   First GUI icons

The skill is how to convey the idea 
They're not just lines, someone will use/look at these everyday.

Icons are language agnostic

**Resource:**
[Noun Project for Mac](https://thenounproject.com/)


####Icons Here and Now
App icons distill as much information as possible into 44x44 square 
Consider icons in action in the interface   
Consider icons for different screen sizes (from apple watch to desktops)

>"A pictogram is a visual translation of a concept. It is a sign: a combination of shapes that carry meaning."

Icons are a mental shortcut.


####When Creating Icons...
When creating icons, mind map key words associated with the topic.  
Start simple (line style) and work up to more detailed styles later.

Send/Receive Context. Who is sending information and who is receiving it. How does this affect their perception of the icons?

If using a conventional icon, make sure the meaning is conventional as well (home icon should take you home)

####Style
Line, 3D, Glyph, Skeuomorphic, Minimal, Illustrative, etc.

####Level of Detail
Less is more.   
A well designed icon captures the essence/idea with the least amount of additional details

####Scale
What are you designing for? iPhone? Desktop? Watch? 
Starting large and scaling down risks losing detail.

####Harmony
Do the icons fit well together? Is there a consistent style, scale, perspective, etc?   
To unify, select a few elements that remain consistent (colour, perspective, line weight, style, details such as line notches, etc).

####Differentiate
Icons need to have similar style but also have different meanings. Each must be independent because when they are at a small sizes, differtiating detail may be lost if not carefully considered.


####Required Reading
Jon Hicks Icon Handbook


####Inspiration

-   Vic Bell - Line icons. Line colour.
-   Tim Van Damme - Check his stuff on dribbble. Designed icons for Dropbox app.
-   Sebastiaan de With - Founder of Pictogram. Designed icons for Microsoft Office. Created his own icons for adobe.
-   Justas Galaburda - Iconutopia.com. 
-   Matt Yow
-   Adam Whitcroft - City icons
-   Behance and Dribbble. Lots of inspiration


####What you will be doing

-   Icon sets (week 1+2)
-   Create your own set of travel icons (car, train, suitcase, boat, compass, etc) depending on your app.

-   City Illustration (weeks 3+4). Don't worry about being perfect, focus on figuring out how it is made.
-   Illustration style needs to match icons for app

-   Travel app (week 5+6) (3 screens minimum. Home, pick a City, Detail of City)


####Tasks:
-   Mind map travel app. Start with word Travel or City
-   **Figure out what the focus of the app will be**
-   Design original set of travel icons for your app

#Week 4
##IXD104//FRIDAY//24-2-17
##04 Illustration in UI. Art in Action

Illustration can improve usability by improving understanding of the interface.

###Why Illustration in UI
A picture is worth a 1000 words. People are drawn to them and understand them faster than copy/text.

###The Essence of Illustration

*Illustrate:*

-   to clarify
-   to make clear by serving as an example
-   to provide visual features intended to explain or decorate
-   to show clearly

In Latin: light up, enlighten, or illuminate.

Illustration always played a part in the past but digital illustration has opened up new possibilities. However, the aim of illustration is still the same.


###Features of Illustration in UI
Illustration in UI shouldn't just be there because it looks nice. It should be a functional and necessary part of the interface.

Illustration needs to serve a purpose. In an interface, they convey information.

The brain understands visuals 600x faster than text and so should be an essential part of an easy to use interface.

Illustration can fulfill multiple user needs. Illustrations should be:

-   Meaningful
-   Recognisable
-   Attractive
-   Harmonic and consistent with general stylistic concept
-   Improve usability and UX in general
-   Not overload the screen or page


###Practices of Illustrations in UI
Illustration can solve problems.

>   Illustration is pictures to read or words to look at" - Quentin Blake

####Types:

-   Mascots and Characters
    -   Images personified to represent brands/products/services. A basic element of communication and interaction. Conveys personality of brand.
    
-   Thematic
    -   Illustrations can convey theme of product/brand
    
-   Iconic
    -   Using icons to tell a story

-   Diagrammatic
    -   Convey information (even complex information) in a simple diagram.

-   Data Visualisation
    -   Visualise and present information (like eye tracking heat maps in UX)
    
####Styles

-   Vector
-   3D
-   Hyper Realistic
-   Minimilist
-   Hand Drawn


###Illustration in UI

####Onboarding
When you get a new app and your experience of 'getting onboard'. Tool tips/tutorials/help so users see and learn how to use your app and continue to use it.

####Rewards
Awards/badges in apps. Adds to a positive user experience.

####Theme and Style Illustrations
Provide visual support to concept/theme of website/app/product.


###Workflow

-   Research
    -   Find reference, inspiration, etc
    
-   Sketch
-   Vector
-   Colour + Shading


###Look at:
*Designers*  

-   Mark Boulton

*Websites* 

-   Carsonified
-   Treehouse
-   StumbleUpon (add-on)


###Tasks
-   Keep working on cityscapes
-   Illustrate your own cityscape

Next week is pulling it all together for app so need to have icons, illustrations, and idea complete.

For the deliverables, must have minimum of 3 screens.

---

#Week 5
##IXD104//FRIDAY//3-3-17

###Tying it Together

###Three screens minimum for app

-   Splash screen (welcome screen)
-   Pick a city
-   City Detail


###Things to Remember

-   Clarity
    -   Is the text legible at every size?
    -   Are the icons clear?
    -   Are  the details subtle and precise (spacing, consisten style, alignment)
    
-   Fluid Motion
    -   Interface is fluid and crisp
    -   People realise what they can interact with
    
-   Depth
    -   Distinct visual layers convey depth and hierarchy
    -   Show what can be used
    
-   Aesthetic Integrity
    -   Aesthetics define the app and how we use it

-   Consistency
    -   Menu, icons, etc on one screen needs to match what is on the other screens
    
-   Make sure people recognise interactions
    -   Direct manipulations engage the user
    -   What does it look like in landscape? On an ipad?
    
-   Feedback to your users
    -   Microinteractions, progress indicator, information when you click on an item, etc.
    -   People want to be informed. If they don't know what they are doing, they will stop using your app.
    
-   Metaphors
    -   The iOS notepad looks like a real notepad.
    -   Helps people understand what to do/what they are doing
    
-   Give users control
    -   Let them customise, add, and search. 
    -   It allows people to become more immersed in your app and have a better experience
    


###Principles of UI

-   Format Content
    -   At the end of the day, it's about the content not just the illustrations/icons.
    -   The content needs to make sense and serve a purpose
    -   Layout should fit the screen. Users should see primary content without scrolling
    
-   Touch Controls
    -   Icons need to be right size for touch
    -   Are gestures intuitive/easy?
    
-   Hit Targets
    -   Where people are pressing
    -   Target needs to be at least about 44x44px
    
-   Text Size
    -   Needs to be at least 11px
    -   Should be legible for a typical viewing experience without zooming
    
-   Contrast
    -   Text should contrast with background so it is legible
    -   Important elements need to be easy to recognise and identifiable from background
    
-   Spacing
    -   Line height
    -   Text shouldn't overlap
    -   Spacing in nav/between icons/text
    
-   Distortion
    -   When using images, make sure they are in intended aspect ration and not distorted
    
-   Organisation
    -   Easy to read layout
    -   Controls should be close to the content they modify
    -   Spacing to improve understanding. Need breathing room for proper organisation.
    
-   Alignment
    -   Make sure everything (text, images, buttons, etc) follow same alignment and spacing.


###Touch Screen Target Sizes
What you press

**Guidelines:**
-   Apple: 44px
-   Microsoft: 34px
-   Nokia: 26px

Small touch targets make users work harder because they require more accuracy. Users must reorintate finger (from finger pad to finger tip) to hit target.

-   Using finger pad comes natural but doing so obscures visibility of target
-   Finger tip shows users their target but they must reorient their finger.

If people have to work hard to use your app, they won't use your app.

Is your app for childern? Then the touch targets might need to be larger and easier to reach.

When small touch targets are close together, users can touch neighbouring targets and accidentally trigger unintended actions.

A lot of people use their thumb. Users shouldn't have to switch from one hand to two hands or thumb to finger to use app.

Different screen sizes may affect placement.

###Finger size

-   Average size of finger pad = 16x20mm = **45x57 px**
-   Average width of thumb = 72px

*Look at natural areas for one handed use (Natural, stretch, wo).*

####Finger size is ideal but not always practical
Screen real estate can be precious and there still needs to be proper spacing between touch targets. Spacing should also accommodate for finger size to prevent accidentally hitting another target.

Can be a benefit because it forces you to simplify nav and concept and not create massive menus with confusing options.


###Test With Keynote
Make a keynote with your screens and link them up to make a simple prototype.


###Touch of Colour
Colour is arguably the second most important after functionality of your app. It plays a critical role in interaction and helps users interperet content/actions.

Critical actions have their own consistent colours.

Limited colour palette can simplify design and make the app easier to understand.

####Colour Scheme Standards

-   Monochramatic
    -   Single colour in different tints/tones
    
-   Analogous
    -   Create from related colours (One dominate and others to enrich).
    -   Easy but the trick is deciding which central colour to use.
    
-   Complimentary Colours
    -   Colours from opposite sides of colour wheel
    -   Contrast can attract attention
    -   Use dominate colour and then complimentary for accents
    
-   Custom

####Impact of Colour Contrast
Colour is almsot always layered on another in interface. Proper use of contrast reduces eye strain and improves ease of use.

####Contrast in Text Readability
Text needs to be legible and have proper contrast ratio.

*WedbAIM - Tool that checks colour contrast*

####Contrast and Users Attention
Contrast can grab user attention and show what can be interacted with.


###Tasks:
3 screens for critique next week.

###Visualising Data

###Data's All Around Us
>"The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly - to develop strategies of seeing and showing." - Edward Tufte

Diagrams - taking data and giving it visual form

The trick is finding the right diagram for the data

####Data's Everywhere
-   Bus timetables
-   Company forecasts
-   Election Results
-   Sales Figures
-   Weather reports


####Edward Tufte
iPhone Reolution by Edward Tufte (video)
-   Computer admin (nav/buttons/etc) debris can steal from content. Better if it can disappear and the user manipulate the content without it.
-   To clarify add detail
-   Clutter and overload are not an attribute of information but of bad design. Don't try and discard information, fix the design.


####David McCandless
Check out his website.  
Does a lot of work for the Guardian. Look at their diagrams.    
-   Influ-Venn-Za venn diagram
-   Who is friends with who in the Middle East


####Nicholas Felton
Annual reports on his own life: *The Feltron Annual Report* 
He lead the design of Facebook's Timeline.



###Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics
Book: *Brian Suda - Designing with Data*

We can reveal (or hide) information.

Read: Lies, Damned Lies, and Apple keynotes article

Context matters and the same information can be presented in different ways to skew it. You should present the information honestly and be aware of how the design affects perception.


###Research Inspiration
-   Edward Tufte
-   David McCandless
-   Nicholas Felton
-   Brendan Dawes


###Tasks
Project 02 + Master Apprentice 03

####Project 02
Create an inforgraphic looking specifically at global population. Research the subject of data visualisation and inforgraphics thoroughly before you start your own piece. Must also research the topic of global population.

Can look at populations specifically
-   Population in a country
-   Population decline
-   Births/deaths in World
-   Population by milestones
-   Population in last 50 years

Do your research! Project = 40% of module.

Use the skills from illustration module to put together inforgraphic.


####Master Apprentice 03
Redraw a chart.

-   Research world population
-   Research data visualisation
-   Decide focus of infographic
-   Master Apprentice (remake chart)

#Week 9
##IXD104//FRIDAY//31-3-17

##Designing Infographics

###A Note on Deliverables

-   3 app screens (40%)
    -   Master Apprentice Exercises
    -   Icons and cityscapes
-   Infographics (40%)
    -   Master Apprentice Exercises (Pie Chart and Bar Chart)
-   Research Blog (20%)

###The Death of Words

*Books: Don Norman*

-   The Design of Everyday Things
-   Emotional Design
-   Also check out his talks on TED


People don't read as much anymore. More visual. People want to digest information visually.

A picture = 1,000 words

As designers we need to familiarise ourselves with diagrams so we can represent data visually. Visuals help people understand.

>"Infographics help fill the gap between words and pictures" - Edward Tufte


###Rise of the Infographic
>"Infographics are graphic representations of information, data or knowledge designed to present information quickly and clearly."

####Potent Forms
Infographics are potent forms of communication. They can convey complex information in an understandable manner.

>"Infographics can imporve cognition by utilising graphics to enhance the human visual system's ability to recognise patterns and trends."

####None of This is New...

-   Diagram of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.
-   Timeline of AirBnB business
-   Get Invited 2nd Birthday Infographic

Should have 10-20 facts for infographic deliverable.

Can 'lighten' the data with characters/fun touches which increase interest and make infographic easier to understand if done well.

*Article: What's the difference between an infographic and a data visualisation - Jack Hagley*

>"Infographics are generally created for the purpose of telling or explaining a specific story, and will usually be intended for a specific audience, thus infographics are subjective." - Jack Hagley

>"Data visualisations should be objective."

In both you're telling a story but visualisations should be objective whereas infographics might mold the data to better present a story.

-   Additional Information
    -   Nicholas Felton Annual Reports



###David McCandless: The Beauty of Data Visualisation
Visualisations help put things in context and identify patterns and correlations.

When you are lost, you need a map. Information can be confusing, data visualisations are the map.

"Data is the new soil"

Need to ask the right question/work the information in the right way.

Data visualisation - combine the language of the eye and the language of th mind. Enhance each other.

Absolute figures don't always give you the full picture. Relative figures can give a fuller context. Visualisations show context which can give a relative and truer representation.

Visualisations are a form of knowledge compression (not always simplification. Easy to understand does not = basic).

#Week 10
##IXD104//FRIDAY//7-4-17

###A Cornucopia of Charts

We've been led to believe that a picture is worth a thousand words. This module puts that truism to the test. Exploring non-verbal communication, we introduce illustrative and diagrammatic content.

20 credits

###Ancient Information
Humans have been using visuals to convey information since ancient times with pictograms, cave paintings, and hieroglyphs, among others.

Pictograms are still in use to day, from icons to signage.

>"It is better to remember the simplified pictures than to forget accurate figures."
- Otto Neurath

####Otto Neurath
Helped develop a set of pictograms to be a general language for humanity. Brought life to previously dry and unaccesible statistics.

####Otl Archer
Designed pictograms for the 1972 Munich Olympics.   
Also cofounded Alm School of Design

####Modern Signage
Road signs and other warning/general signs are examples of modern pictograms.

Symbols have to work on a universal scale and across language boundaries.

####Susan Kare
Designed original icons for the original Macintosh



###Visualising the World
People want to understand the world.

Old atlases and maps of the cosmos.


###Visualising Us
People want to understand themselves.

Early anatomy 'maps'. Helped advance medicine and understanding of the body.

####Edward Snow
Made maps to chart cholora outbreak and narrow it down to a specific water pump.


####Florence Nightengale
Designed diagram to show how soldiers were dying and how many more were dying from preventable diseases. She used this to show the need for improvement in hospital conditions to save lives.




###The Origins of the Chart
William Playfair and Johan ? designed many of the original charts such as bar charts.

####Harry Beck
Engineer who produced the first sketch of the London underground map. Realised that the problem was the old maps were *too* accurate. Abstracted it to focus on the key information, like a data visualisation. Exact distance is not as important as how many stops are between you and your destination.
Actually quite like a circuit schematic





###Charts Today
Your data is only as good as your ability to understand and communicate it, which is why choosing the right visualisation is essential.

Ideal distanc between bars in a bar chart: half the width of a bar

####Find the story in your data

-   Trends
-   Correlations
-   Outliers

####Know your data

-   Quantitative
    -   Data that can be counted or measured.
-   Discrete
    -   Data that has finite numbers
-   Continous
    -   Rain fall in a year
-   Categorical

    -   Use the right height (make sure graph takes up at least 2/3)
    
-   Scatter Plots
    -   Good at showing correlations between two variables
    -   Start axis at 0
    -   Use Trend lines
    -   Don't compare more than 2 variables
    
-   Bubble Charts
    -   Good at showing relationships/comparisons
    -   Can combine with scatter plot for additonal variable
    -   Make sure labels are visible
    -   Size bubbles appropriately
    -   Don't use odd shapes
    
-   Heat Map
    -   Heat maps display values using intensity of colour
    -   Use a simple map outline
    -   Select colours appropriately
    -   Use patterns sparingly
    -   Choose appropriate data ranges
  
  
  
###Do's and Don'ts 

**DO:**

-   Do use one colour to represent each category
-   Order data sets in logical hierarchy
-   Use call outs to highlist interesting information
-   Use icons highlight information and elimante labels


**DON'T**

-   Use high contrast colours
-   Use 3D Charts that can skew perception
-   Use chart junk, unnecessary illustrations/drop shadows/ornaments
-   Use more than 6 colours
-   Use distracting typefaces such as too much italic or underline.
