####Icon Design
>Trying to capture the essence of an object/idea with only a few lines while maintaining its elegance.
Icons are tiny poems.
-Kyle Tezak

**Icons are old as old as the hills**
-   Cave paintings
-   Olympic icons
-   First GUI icons

The skill is how to convey the idea 
They're not just lines, someone will use/look at these everyday.

Icons are language agnostic

####Icons Here and Now
App icons distill as much information as possible into 44x44 square 
Consider icons in action in the interface   
Consider icons for different screen sizes (from apple watch to desktops)

>"A pictogram is a visual translation of a concept. It is a sign: a combination of shapes that carry meaning."

Icons are a mental shortcut.


####When Creating Icons...
When creating icons, mind map key words associated with the topic.  
Start simple (line style) and work up to more detailed styles later.

Send/Receive Context. Who is sending information and who is receiving it. How does this affect their perception of the icons?

If using a conventional icon, make sure the meaning is conventional as well (home icon should take you home)

####Style
Line, 3D, Glyph, Skeuomorphic, Minimal, Illustrative, etc.

####Level of Detail
Less is more.   
A well designed icon captures the essence/idea with the least amount of additional details

####Scale
What are you designing for? iPhone? Desktop? Watch? 
Starting large and scaling down risks losing detail.

####Harmony
Do the icons fit well together? Is there a consistent style, scale, perspective, etc?   
To unify, select a few elements that remain consistent (colour, perspective, line weight, style, details such as line notches, etc).

####Differentiate
Icons need to have similar style but also have different meanings. Each must be independent because when they are at a small sizes, differtiating detail may be lost if not carefully considered.
