####Caves to Kells recap
Writing systems developed.

Medieval scripts (Insular Script).  
Lindisfarne Gospels. Book of Kells.

German Blackletter developed around 1100ad. Angular. Easy to lay out.

Illuminated manuscripts could take a year or more to produce. Only the church or the wealthy could afford such books.


####Type

> Type is the clothing for words. 

Different typefaces give different expectations, from refined to playful.


####Early Printing
Earliest methods developed in China. Would carve the forms into jade or stone tablets and use it to create relief prints.

####Johannes Gutenberg 1395-1468
The Gutenberg Bible. A 'Revisionary Inventor'. Refined the metal type printing process. Scribes were no longer necessary and the bible and other books could be mass produced, making knowledge more accessible to all.

Printers' marks - Like mason marks. A kind of logo or brand. Resemble runes.

Sayings originated from the printing methods such as "Mind your Ps and Qs" (they were next to each other in drawers) and uppercase/lowercase (capital letters were kept in the upper case and vice versa)

-   **Albert Exergian** - Posters for TV series (True Blood, 50 Rock, and others).

####WWI
Propaganda posters and campaigns to convince people to enlist or contribute to the war effort. Style still used to today (**Marco Manev** - minimal Marvel movie posters) and play with link to the past.

9.  Screw perfection
10. Following the rules make your work look like everyone else's
